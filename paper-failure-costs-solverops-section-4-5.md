## **4. Bidding Strategies**

In decentralized order flow auctions, participants (solvers) compete for the right to execute user orders. Unlike conventional single-shot auctions, these environments feature added complexity: the eventual profit or loss depends not only on the solver’s private valuation of the transaction but also on uncertain future states (e.g., asset prices) and on the presence of $\textit{failure costs}$—penalties imposed if a solver fails to execute after winning.

These conditions mean that no solver can simply pick a strategy without anticipating the equilibrium responses of others. As a result, the mechanism naturally leads to a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE), where each solver’s bid accounts for both the distribution of others’ valuations and the probability of unfavorable future outcomes.

### 4.1 Theoretical Framework

Consider $n$ solvers, indexed by $i=1,\dots,n$. Each solver $i$ obtains a private valuation $v_i$, drawn i.i.d. from a known distribution $F(v)$ with PDF $f(v)$, supported on $[v_{\min}, v_{\max}]$. The valuation $v_i$ reflects the solver’s expected net gain from executing the user’s trade at time $t_1$. Upon observing $v_i$, solver $i$ chooses a bid $b(v_i)$.

At equilibrium, we seek a symmetric, monotonically increasing equilibrium bidding function $b^\*(v)$. In this BNE, no solver can profitably deviate from $b^\*(v)$ given that all other solvers also use $b^\*(v)$.

Let $X$ be a random variable representing future market conditions (e.g., realized asset price at execution). If solver $i$ wins by bidding $b(v_i)$:

- If $X \ge b(v_i)$, executing the transaction yields a payoff approximately $X - b(v_i)$.
- If $X < b(v_i)$, executing would be unprofitable, and the solver optimally fails, incurring a failure cost $c_{fail}(o_i)$.

Formally, solver $i$ solves:

$$\max_{b}\ \mathbb{E}{v{-i}, X}\bigl[U_i(b, b_{-i}^\*(v_{-i}), X) \mid v_i \bigr],$$

subject to $b = b^*(v_i)$. The expectation is taken over the valuations $v_{-i}$ of other solvers and the state $X$.

### 4.2 Uncertainty, Failure Costs, and Payoff Structure

At bidding time $t_0$, $v_i$ is known to solver $i$ but $X$ is not. Let $F_X(x)$ and $f_X(x)$ be the CDF and PDF of $X$. If solver $i$ wins with bid $b(v_i)$, the expected ex-post payoff is:

$$\mathbb{E}[(X - b(v_i))\mathbf{1}\{X \ge b(v_i)\}] \;-\; \mathbb{E}[c_{fail}(o_i)\mathbf{1}\{X < b(v_i)\}],$$

where $\mathbf{1}\{\cdot\}$ is an indicator function.

The failure cost $c_{fail}(o_i)$ is defined as:

$$c_{fail}(o_i) =
\begin{cases}
(b(v_i) - b(v_j^{\checkmark}))\frac{g(o_i)}{\Gamma}, & \text{if some solver } j>i \text{ executes successfully }\\
b(v_i)\frac{g(o_i)}{\Gamma}, & \text{if no solver succeeds}
\end{cases}$$

This cost structure penalizes overly aggressive bids that cannot be profitably executed and ensures solvers internalize the risk of non-performance.

### 4.3 Deriving the Equilibrium

In a symmetric equilibrium, all solvers use $b^\*(v)$. Differentiating the expected utility $U_i(b)$ w.r.t. $b$ at $b = b^\*(v)$ and setting it to zero yields:
$$\frac{dU_i}{db}\bigg|_{b = b^\*(v)} = 0.$$

This first-order condition encodes the solver’s trade-off:

- Increasing $b^\*(v)$ raises the probability of winning but reduces the marginal gain in states $X \ge b^\*(v)$.
- It also increases expected penalties if $X < b^\*(v)$.

Solving this equation typically requires numerical or iterative methods. Existence of equilibrium can be argued by standard fixed-point theorems in Bayesian games, though uniqueness or closed-form solutions are not guaranteed.

### 4.4 Extensions and Complexity

Realistic environments often involve:

- **Correlated Valuations:** Knowledge of one solver’s valuation informs beliefs about others, adding complexity.
- **Asymmetric Information:** Some solvers may better predict $X$.
- **Dynamic or Multi-Stage Settings:** Over multiple rounds, solvers learn and adapt, potentially generating Markov Perfect Equilibria.

Such cases require advanced solution concepts, order-statistic analyses, or computational equilibrium-finding algorithms, aligning this research with ongoing cryptoeconomic and mechanism design efforts to handle complex, stateful, and strategically rich environments.

## **5. Implications & Observations**

The equilibrium characterization provides a theoretical scaffold for evaluating the broader implications of the failure cost mechanism on censorship resistance, capital efficiency, complexity of market design, and potential R&D directions.

### 5.1 Valuations, Bids, and Execution Outcomes

In standard first-price auctions, bidders shade below their valuations. Here, failure costs introduce a second dimension of bid shading, reflecting uncertain execution outcomes:

- **Risk-Adjusted Bid Shading:** Solvers incorporate not just valuation differences but also the distribution of $X$ and the probability $X < b(v)$.
- **Distributional Sensitivity:** Changes in $F(v)$ or $F_X(x)$ alter equilibrium strategies. Increased volatility or skewness in $X$ leads to more conservative bidding to hedge against increased downside risk.

### 5.2 Censorship Resistance, Throughput, and Capital Efficiency

The blockchain’s throughput parameter $\Gamma$ influences how many solver operations fit into a block and affects the ratio $\frac{g(o_i)}{\Gamma}$:

- **Enhanced Competition:** Higher $\Gamma$ reduces relative penalties, enabling broader participation and intensifying competition.
- **Censorship Resistance:** As $\Gamma$ grows, censorship costs increase linearly, disincentivizing malicious attempts to block others. Equilibrium bids reflect greater confidence in fair competition.
- **Capital Efficiency:** With lower relative failure costs, solvers commit fewer resources per attempt, improving liquidity and potentially reducing slippage. Over time, this can yield a more efficient, stable, and accessible market.

### 5.3 Applications to Complex Market Architectures

The failure cost equilibrium supports advanced cryptoeconomic mechanisms:

- **Cross-Chain and Multi-Step Trades:** Known minimum outcomes and equilibrium bidding strategies that internalize execution risk anchor trust in asynchronous multi-chain protocols. This reduces counterparty risk and fosters more complex inter-chain liquidity solutions.
- **Dynamic and Algorithmic Market Making:** In repeated or continuous-time settings, solvers can leverage algorithmic approaches, reinforcement learning, or simulation-based equilibrium approximations to adapt strategies on-the-fly, potentially stabilizing into steady-state or Markov equilibria.
- **Correlated Valuations and Informed Traders:** Introducing correlation or differential information about $X$ opens new research directions. For instance, how does partial information revelation affect equilibrium bids and outcomes? Such questions align with cryptoeconomic models where privacy, signaling, and information asymmetry shape strategic interaction.

### 5.4 Connections to Auction Theory, Mechanism Design, and Cryptoeconomics

This analysis resonates with established principles in auction theory and extends them to the cryptoeconomic arena:

- **Auction Foundations:** Just as bidders shade below valuations in a first-price auction, here they also account for the probability of failure, effectively adding a state-contingent dimension to bid optimization.
- **Contingent Claims Interpretation:** The mechanism resembles trading options on future states $X$, where the bid acts like a strike price and failure costs function as margin requirements, preventing reckless speculation.
- **Cryptoeconomic Perspective:** Implementing failure costs ensures “skin in the game,” where solvers bear real consequences for defaulting. This aligns incentives, discourages manipulative strategies, and exemplifies robust cryptoeconomic engineering.
